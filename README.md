# A Backend with node.js, Express and postgreSQL for API Rests 

### + This is a backend that contains some endpoints. These endpoints are being consuming by an e-commerce.
### + This is the first iteration of my backend project. Need more middlewares and validation of users with their documents.
### + I want to implement this backend with a frontend React.js app.
### + The original idea is to build an application for my portfolio.
